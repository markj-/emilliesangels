	<h1>Emillie's Angels</h2>

		<img src="kate.jpeg">
		
		<p>Our flat's Kate Moss Christmas tree angel was created on a whim, probably after a visit to the pub, from little more than a cut-out magazine page, a loo roll tube and some feathers.</p>

		<p>Now approaching its - or should we say her - third glorious Christmas, the time has come for festive appendages like this to be available to all in exchange for a donation to <a href="http://www.refuge.org.uk/">Refuge</a>.</p>

		<p>Kate Moss was our choice, who will be yours?</p>

		<h2>The Prototype</h2>

		<p>A simple cardboard loo roll tube is cleverly disguised with a selection of metallic paperchain loops (more versatile than you thought!).</p>

		<p>Affixed to to the front is Kate herself, resplendent in gold and reinforced with some extra cardboard to protect the glossy but flimsy magazine page.</p>

		<p>This is all finished off with a pair of real (or very realistic) feather wings.</p>

		<h2>Your angel</h2>

		<p>The notes above would be sufficient for you to create your very own Christmas tree angel yourself, but if you'd rather this magical item arrived fully formed on your doorstep, then look no further.</p>

		<p>Either choose your own perfect photograph/illustration and email (or post) it over, give us enough info to source it for you, or simply leave it completely up to us.</p>

		<p>By default the bit of your angel that fits on the top of tree will be the size of a normal loo roll tube, but if you have a bigger tree (or envisage placing it somewhere else) just mention this when you order and the circumference can be whatever you need -- within reason.</p>

		<p>It will be carefully handmade with a mixture of materials and your chosen figure (a friend? Kim Jong Un? Kim Kardashian? a surprise?).</p>

		<p>When you email your order you'll be sent a link to a JustGiving page for you to donate &pound;4.00 (suggested; it can be more if you like). If you'd be happy to contribute towards the posting, packing and material costs please mention when you order.</p>

		<p>Finally, your angel can be made without wings if you'd rather a less biblical tree topping or want to use it for something else. Feel free to suggest alternative accessories.</p>
